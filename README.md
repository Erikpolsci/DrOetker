# DrOetker
 
Since the first language I learned, I have always tried to take the code to my daily life, seeking to apply technology to reality and this project was exactly the result of that thought. I currently work operating industrial machinery at Dr.Oetker Canada and after getting in touch with a new role at the factory, I found that, like me, people new to this position had difficulty with the calculations to determine the required amount of materials to be brought from the warehouse. . After understanding the calculation, I noticed that I could develop something to help. I talked to more experienced people in the function, who gave me suggestions and implemented the code. But what about the design? The application needed to have a friendly appearance, be intuitive and clear, without losing the company's visual identity. For this, I used the Giuseppe pizza line and the brand's colors as inspiration. A relatively simple application, but it prevents errors and helps the work of many people, especially those who have just started in the stock supply position.
Diagnose, understand and create. Programming, in my view, is about finding solutions to everyday problems and making people's lives easier. Programming is simplifying.
